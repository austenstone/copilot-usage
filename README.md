# Copilot Usage Action

Get Copilot usage data as:
* Md Job Summary
* CSV
* XML
* JSON

Powered by the [REST API endpoints for GitHub Copilot usage metrics](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage).

> [!TIP]
> üöÄ Get this running FAST by using the [template](https://github.com/austenstone/copilot-usage-template)

## Usage
Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/copilot-usage.yml`). See [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### PAT(Personal Access Token)

You will need to [create a PAT(Personal Access Token)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=manage_billing:copilot) that has the `manage_billing:copilot`, `read:org`, or `read:enterprise` scopes to use this endpoint.

Add this PAT as a secret so we can use it as input `github-token`, see [Creating encrypted secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). 

#### Basic Example

The default behavior is to get the usage for the repository owner which is likely the organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You need to set the secret `TOKEN` in your repository settings.

```yml
name: Copilot Usage
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run:
    name: Run Action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: austenstone/copilot-usage@v5.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          time-zone: 'EST'
```

#### Example get team usage

```yml
      - uses: austenstone/copilot-usage@v5.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          organization: 'org-slug'
          team: 'team-slug'
```

#### Example get CSV

```yml
      - uses: austenstone/copilot-usage@v5.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          csv: true
```

#### Example multiple teams
```yml
    strategy:
      matrix:
        team:
          - 'team-slug1'
          - 'team-slug2'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: austenstone/copilot-usage@v5.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          organization: 'org-slug'
          team: ${{ matrix.team }}
```

#### Example specific timezone

You probably want to specify the timezone to get the usage in your local time. The default is UTC.
EX: `EST`, `PST`, `CST`, [etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

```yml
      - uses: austenstone/copilot-usage@v5.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
          organization: 'org-slug'
          time-zone: 'EST'
```

#### Example sending email PDF report

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must set secrets for `EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` to send the email. You must use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?visit_id=638496193361004722-1436339969&p=InvalidSecondFactor&rd=1#app-passwords) for Gmail.
